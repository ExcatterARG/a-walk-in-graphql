## Exercise

For a given datasource ([abstracted as json here](datasource/data.json)) containing `n` rows of `skills` and `n` rows of `persons` we provided a sample implementation of a GraphQL server for each technology containing:

- a server app
- a schema
- a resolver map
- an entity model
- a db abstraction

The code contains the solution for previous exercises so you can have a starting point example.

### Exercise requirements

#### Operations list

```graphql
